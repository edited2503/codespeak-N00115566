This is a assignment for iadt computer networks where i built a multi-room chat application using node.js and socket.io. 
It doesn't store to a database just a basic chat room in each room once refreshed will lose the data sent on screen. 
Also adding a name hasn't been developed is a wip will develop in the future.

1. run npm run start - to get application in the terminal i used bash
2. in browser type - localhost:1000 -thats the port i coded it to run
3. ensure you have latest node installed on pc
